# This is a configurations file for Micro-Primers pipeline. 
# Here you can set the parameteres necessary for runing micro-primers.
# 
# You can set the options for:
# - Input files;
# - Cutadapt adapters;
# - SSR search parameters.

#Input files

INPUT_FILES_R1=Fish_R1.fastq
INPUT_FILES_R2=Fish_R2.fastq

#CUTADAPT

CUTADAPT_3=CCAAGCTTCCCGGGTACCGC
CUTADAPT_5=GCGGTACCCGGGAAGCTTGG

#SSR

# Minimum length for the region flanking the microsssatelite (SSR);
MIN_FLANK_LEN=50

# Minimum size of ssr pattern;
MIN_MOTIF_REP=5

# Class of SSR to exclude (c & c*- Compost, p1 - 1 letter ssr, etc.)
EXC_MOTIF_TYPE=c,c*,p1

#Minimum number of alleles in cluster
MIN_ALLEL_CNT=5

#Special search, for when the number of alleles in each cluster doesn't surpass the minimum. If this option is active MIN_ALLEL_CNT is not taken into account. (1 - ACTIVE; 0 - DISABLE)
MIN_ALLEL_SPECIAL=0

#Minimum difference between allele with higher number of repeats and the allele with less number of repeats
MIN_ALLEL_SPECIAL_DIF=6
